# This is Not Normal Flu — Not Even in the Best Case.

The World Health Organization estimate of 3.5% is an average across age groups, and they have provided large surveillance data as evidence against high numbers of asymptomatic cases. There is very strong consensus that those aged 60+ and those with underlying conditions are the most impacted.

Earlier in the epidemic, there was hope that 3.5 percent was grossly overestimated, however as evidence continues to emerge, there is [dwindling support for that hope](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/new-data-from-china-buttress-fears-about-high-coronavirus-fatality-rate-who-expert-says/). The numbers out of South Korea are so far the most optimistic in the world ([0.7% cases were fatal](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1236914078632812544)); however, a) the South Korean population is younger on average and b) South Korea (in contrast to the USA) have been doing everything right from the earliest stages of the outbreak: they have done massive roll out of testing coupled with radical transparency, public support and [brilliant drive-through testing!](https://twitter.com/cnni/status/1234524871226482688) If this strain of Coronavirus is like other viruses, aggressive measures that reduce transmission, may also lower the average ‘dose’ of viral particles that cause any given case; this might reduce the average severity of disease and decrease overall death rates. Time will tell.

Moreover, even IF the true Covid-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% ([as it is so far with the Diamond Princess](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article)), that would already be [ten times higher than a typical seasonal flu](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).
