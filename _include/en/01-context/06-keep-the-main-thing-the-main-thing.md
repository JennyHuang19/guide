# Keep the Main Thing the Main Thing: [**\#FlattenTheCurve**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlattenTheCurve?src=hashtag_click)**.Â **]

A lot of ink has been spilled on speculation about the "true" rate; however we are still in the early phase of the pandemic and it could
take years to precisely determine the rate. BUT we know that it is somewhere **between .5% and 4 percent mortality; this range is more than
adequate evidence to warrant decisive, immediate, large-scale preventive action**. Far and away, the most important thing to do is [flatten the
curve of the epidemic](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/02/29/covid-19-is-now-in-50-countries-and-things-will-get-worse)
so that our health systems can cope and to give time for the scientists to research vaccines and treatments.
