## No country is fully prepared, including the United States

Although the [WHO's JEE report from 2016](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254701/WHO-WHE-CPI-2017.13-eng.pdf) rates the US highly in preparedness for a public health emergency, even we are woefully underprepared for this pandemic.
For example, our health care capacity is under 1 million staffed beds, but that is far less than the [4-8 million hospitalizations we
are expected to see](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).
We simply don't have the equipment, training, or messaging in place and we need to ramp up fast.
No one does.
That is why your choices today matter so much.

Those of us with colleagues in Northern Italy (the region hardest hit) know they have exceptional physicians, infectious disease docs, and immunologists. They also have effectively universal care, so [this is not a developing-world tale that is irrelevant for the US situation.](https://twitter.com/drkomanduri/status/1236720751073546240)
