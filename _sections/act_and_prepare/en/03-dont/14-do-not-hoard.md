### Do not hoard supplies 

Items often becoming in short supply due to hoarding include toilet paper and bottled water.

Don't buy extra bottled water; tap water is very unlikely to be impacted and boiling would be adequate if it turned out it were needed for unforeseen reasons. 

Get what you need. Leave the rest for others.
