# Relative to other countries, US labor and healthcare policies are a perfect storm for pandemics

-   Zero universal guaranteed [paid sick leave](https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/for-how-long-are-workers-guaranteed-paid-sick-leave)
-   Even among those \*with\* paid sick leave, the covered time frame is often on the order of days, not the weeks adequate to account for
    prolonged illness.
-   Zero guaranteed paid family leave to care for sick members
-   Zero guaranteed financial or operational support for people who should self-quarantine. [People are therefore ignoring quarantine
    because they need to eat.](https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/1236462655012917249)
-   Many people are uninsured. Given where things are right now (cryptic transmission and no available vaccine), the insurance companies have
    a moral obligation but have no financial incentive to improve testing and ensure access to care.
-   In the USA insurance is tied to their employment, so when they get sick they are also vulnerable to bankruptcy. In a pandemic year this is devastating for an economy.

The fact that these safety nets do not exist in the US will complicate the behaviors required to #flattenthecurve compared to most other countries affected so far.

Doctors worldwide are getting pummeled on the frontlines of this crisis,
the lack of protective equipment is causing them to get infected, and themselves unable to get the care they need. For a personal lens on
this, have a look [here](https://twitter.com/stuff_so/status/1236467114933813248), but this is by no means unique; the accounts are flooding in.

Globally speaking, [authoritarianism is also bad for pandemic control](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/) since it stifles the expertise and transparency required to make the best use of resources. Examples of this are most acutely seen in places like China (earliest in the epidemic), and now Iran. Statistically it is impossible that Turkey or Russia have no cases. The fact that the [CDC site is not being updated over weekends](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1236876030138294272) does
not bode well.
