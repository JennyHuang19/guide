## If You'd Like to Help Contribute to the Site's Operation

First of all, thank you! A lot of unpaid work is going into this site to try and make it one of the best and most helpful resources in this
uncertain time of COVID19. There are, however, some hard costs associated with that, like the cost of hosting, or potentially hiring
someone to help manage the work as the site grows.

**If you'd like to contribute**, we're very grateful for any amount, and [you can do so at this PayPal link](https://paypal.me/markey).

Don't feel obligated to contribute--this information is free to access and share.

Please be assured that all money collected will go back toward running, building, and maintaining this site.

Thanks again! And wash your hands. ðŸ™‚
