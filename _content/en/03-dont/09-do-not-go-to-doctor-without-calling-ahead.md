## DO NOT GO TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT CALLING AHEADÂ 

Do NOT go directly to the hospital. More guidance from CDC [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html).

Call centers are understandably overwhelmed right now with the "worried well" so please try to leave those lines open for the people who really
need them.
